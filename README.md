This is a Julia package that wraps the Robert Saye's Algoim library: https://algoim.github.io/.  Specifically, we provide an interface to his quadrature algorithms for domains implicitly-defined by multivariate polynomials.  If you use this library in a paper, please cite his work:

> R. I. Saye, _"High-order quadrature on multi-component domains implicitly defined by multivariate polynomials,"_ Journal of Computational Physics, 448, 110720 (2022).

The docs link above includes a few basic examples of how to use the library.
